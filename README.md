## Structure

In order to improve the navigation of the website i have organised like a tree to ensure the user navigates through the website
![Project Development](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/d429adc0-18c6-457d-9d74-14d37895b7a7)

I made a database digram to be aware of the additional functionalities i want to add as well as the essential models i need to add to get the website functioning.


![Screenshot 2023-12-15 133427](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/8ee88717-c137-4f71-ab1a-cf7b200f0b46)

### Skeleton 

I made a basic wireframes for the structure as I was not sure if I wanted to stick with the structure I just made sure I had a rough idea on what I wanted on the homepage.

![Homepage](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/97ba1ca1-235a-417e-8d28-edaa680d95ec)

For the products page I made sure that there was a categories bar so the user can easily navigate around different categories. I wanted a like button to be on the side of the categories bar.

![products page](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/0e64f0f1-6b48-40d3-9931-e64f68348070)

The products details page should just have the image of the products and the descriptions of the product and the ability to comment (initially I was not sure if i should add the commenting functionality).

![PRODUCT DETAILS Page](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/6008b188-9871-4e29-8ab6-7dd60b5eb76f)

When the customer adds a item to the basket the basket will hang down the page so that the customer can see what they have added as well as the size of the clothing/shoes

![Basket image](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/153e5466-0c50-4335-8510-c388a4b08194)

Once the customer proceeds to checkout the checkou page would open allowing the user to enter in their shipping details name etc.

![CHECKOUT PAGE ](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/b1efaef4-6b2e-4af1-90cc-214b7d60aa1c)

After the user goes through checkout they will be presented with the checkout success page confirming the payment and an email would be sent to the email entered in during the checkout.

![THANKYOU PAGE](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/ba329421-40d6-48c1-b8d0-ef0e50597eec)

These are the colours I was looking to use before starting my project. As the UK street wear colour scheme consists of the colours black and white for example. I made sure colours were contrasting to ensure the users can easily read the text and make a purchase. Moreover individuals with visual impairments can benefit off the colour scheme.
![colour pallette](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/5fac7fb4-ae51-4753-b592-422cd8eb477d)


# Marketing

After knowing I wanted to pursue a streewear business in London I started to research other businesses that sell the same products/services to get some ideas on what objects sell the most. I found the staples for London streetwear were:

- Hoodies
- Beanie Hats
- Puffer Jackets
- Tracksuits
- Sunglasses

## Business Model

Drip By Salmz is a B2C that offer premium clothing so our customers feel their best!. Its our goal to make sure that our customers feel their best wearing our products.

## Customers
Anyone can buy from our business. Primarily my targer audience are the younger generations from around 18-25 as the products are a little on the pricier side.

## Competitors

Wth the clothing industry their are a lot of competitors including clothing retailers like JD Sports who sell similar products to us. Whilst listing out competitors ive found that a lot of businesses sell their products on social medias like Tick Tok where. However I found that these businesses are more small/medium enterprises. Examples of bigger companies are JDs, Sport Direct, FootAsylum, Footlocker.
 
### SWOT analysis

#### Strengths

- Products being sold are very trendy
- London consists of the right target market as a lot of the youth like the same thing.

### Weaknesses
- A lot of competitors in the same region
- New Brand
- No Unique Selling Point.

### Opportunities
- A lot of products that are hard to get hold of by other businesses (rare items)
- A lot of marketing opportunities if collaborations are made between different companies

### Threats
- A lot of competiton who market very well using social media such as tick tok.
- Bigger companies can change their product supply due to generating significantly more revenue
- Shipping costs are variable

## Marketing stretegy
As the marketing budget is not high, we developed a Facebook Page to start us off. Ijn the future when we get more publicity we hope to make a TickTok page to further market our business so that we can generate more customers. Additioanlly we can inform customers regarding upcoming offers and new product drops to increase our chances of breaking even. We could get in touch with some influencers to inform more people about our products/services.

## Testing

I tested the HTML there were a few errors at the start with a few things. The errors I got were related to the same IDs being in the tags. These erros are now corrected. To correct these warnings and errors I used the [w3c HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fdripzs-by-salmz-006e3a5f6351.herokuapp.com%2F).

I used the same thing for CSS and got no errors. [w3c schools css validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdripzs-by-salmz-006e3a5f6351.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en).

For python I used the PEP8 validator for each of the django apps. There is a strnage indentation error which I dont know how to correct. No matter how I indent the code.
[Python Validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#). Thre were a lot of files to look through but the erros are now corrected. I also ran the command python3 -m flake8 which listed out all the erors in the terminal. I corrected the errors I could as if i corrected the line length of the rest of the lines the code would break and alot of the functionalities stopped working.

## Accessibility 
I lighthouse tested all of the main pages of the website.

## Resubmissions

- Initially when the admin made a new product it would be added twice to the basket which i didnt realiose initially. It was a quick fix as the logic that addewd the product twice had to be removed. I didnt realise that this happened.

- I liked the idea of the colour scheme even though it resembled that of the Boutique Ado project. I have no intention of copying the project.

- Debug has now been set to False. Small error costed my entire project

- The errors from the failed prject have been resolved as now the confirmation emails should work. The payments should show correctly on the Admin control panel now.



## Deployment
 
The project was developed using[GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) workspace. The code was commited to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/") using the terminal. The web application is deployed on Heroku as Github Pages is not able to host a Python project. Static and media files are being stored in AWS S3. The repository is hosted on Github.


### How To Use This Project
To use and further develop this project you can either fork or clone the repository.  


#### Fork GitHub Repository
By forking the GitHub repository you can make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository, by using the following steps:  

1. Log in to GitHub.  
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to fork.  
3. At the top right of the Repository just below your profile picture, locate the "Fork" button.  
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.  
5. Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request.  


#### Clone Github Repository
By cloning a GitHub repository you can create a local copy on your computer of the remote repository. The developer who clones a repository can synchronize their copy of the codebase with any updates made by fellow developers with push or pull request. Cloning is done by using the following steps:  

1. Log in to GitHub.  
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to clone.  
3. Above the list of files, click the dropdown called "Code".  
4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", copy the link.  
5. Open Git Bash.  
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.  
7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 4.  
```$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY```
8. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.   
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```  
Changes made on the local machine (cloned repository) can be pushed to the upstream repository directly if you have a write access for the repository. Otherwise, the changes made in the cloned repository are first pushed to the forked repository, and then a pull request is created.  
Click [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) to retrieve pictures for some of the buttons and more detailed explanations of the above process.  


#### Project Set Up After Forking or Cloning  
1. Install all dependencies by typing in the CLI ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```  
2. Create a ```.gitignore``` file and ```env.py``` file in the project's root directory. Add the ```env.py``` file to ```.gitignore```. 
3. Inside the env.py file, enter the project's environment variables:   
   ```
   import os

   os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", <your_secret_key>)
   os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", '1')
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", <your_key>)
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", <your_key>)
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", <your_key>)
   ```   
   You can get the keys from:
   - "SECRET_KEY" can be generated using [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)   
   - "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY" and "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY" can be generated by creating a stripe account. The keys are found in 'Developers' Section, under 'API Keys'.  
   - In the Developer Section, under 'Webhooks', add a new endpoint.  "STRIPE_WH_SECRET". On Endpoint URL, enter:  
   ``` https://<your_host_url>/checkout/wh/ ```   
   Select to listen to all events, and create endpoint, and you can view your "STRIPE_WH_SECRET".   

4. Make migrations to setup the inital database operations.  
   ``` 
   python3 manage.py makemigrations 
   python3 manage.py migrate 
   ```   
5. Load data for the database or create data manually. 
   ```
   python3 manage.py loaddata <app_name>
   ``` 
6. Create a super user.
   ```
   python3 manage.py create superuser
   ```  
The project should now complete to run and can now be used for development. To run the project, type in the CLI terminal: ```python3 manage.py runserver```     


### Deployment to Heroku 
This project is deployed on Heroku for production, with all static and media files stored on AWS S3. These are steps to deploy on Heroku:

1. Navigate to Heroku.com, create a new account or login if you already have an account. On the dashboard page, click "Create New App" button. Give the app a name, the name must be unique with hypens between words. Set the region closest to you, and click "Create App".   
2. On the resources tab, provision a new Heroku Postgres database.  
3. Configure variables on Heroku by navigating to Settings, and click on Reveal Config Vars. You may not have all the values yet. Add the others as you progress through the steps.   
   Varables | Key   
   ---| ---   
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | your_access_key_id_from_AWS   
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | your_secret_access_key_from_AWS  
   DATABASE_URL | your_database_url   
   EMAIL_HOST_PASS | your_app_password_from_your_email   
   EMAIL_HOST_USER | your_email_address  
   SECRET_KEY | your_secret_key 
   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | your_stripe_public_key  
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | your_stripe_secret_key  
   USE_AWS | True 

4. If you haven't install it, install dj_database_url and psycopg2.
   ```
   pip3 install dj_database_url
   pip3 install psycopg2-binary
   ```
   Note: you don't have to do this if you've installed all dependencies in the requirements.txt file.  
5. Set up a new database for the site by going to the project's settings.py and importing dj_database_url. Comment out the database's default configuration, and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse and pass it the database URL from Heroku (you can get it from your config variables in your app setting tab)
   ```
   DATABASES = {
     'default': dj_database_url.parse('YOUR_DATABASE_URL_FROM_HEROKU')
   }
   ```
6. Run migrations
   ```
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```  
7. Import data to the database.
    - Make sure your manage.py file is connected to your sqlite3 database.
    - Use this command to backup your current database and load it into a db.json file:
    ```
    ./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes > db.json
    ```
    - Connect your manage.py file to your postgres database
    - Then use this command to load your data from the db.json file into postgres:
    ``` 
    ./manage.py loaddata db.json
    ``` 
8. Set up a new superuser, fill out the username, email address, and password.
   ```
   python3 manage.py create superuser
   ```  
9. Remove the database config from Heroku and uncomment the original config. Add a conditional statement to define that when the app is running on Heroku. we connect to Postgres, and otherwise, we connect to Sqlite.   
   ```
   if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
      DATABASES = {
         'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
      }
   else:
      DATABASES = {
         'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
         }
      }
   ```  
10. Install gunicorn which will act as the webserver, and put it on the requirements.txt.   
   ``` 
   pip3 install gunicorn
   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
   Note: you don't have to do this if you've installed all dependencies in the requirements.txt file.
11. Create a Procfile, to tell Heroku to create a web dyno, which will run unicorn and serve the Django app.   

   Inside the Procfile:
   ```
   web: gunicorn shoes_and_more.wsgi:application
   ```
12. Login to Heroku through CLI, using ```heroku login```. Once logged in, disable the collect static temporarily, so that Heroku won't try to collect static files when it deploys.
   ```
   heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app shoes-and-more
   ```
   And add the hostname of the Heroku app to allowed hosts in the project's settings.py, and also add localhost so that Gitpod will still work as well:  
   ```
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['shoes-and-more.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
   ```   
13. Add, commit, and push to gitpod and then to Heroku. After pushing to gitpod as usual, initialize git remote first:
   ```
   heroku git:remote -a shoes-and-more
   ``` 
   Then push to Heroku:
   ```
   git push heroku main
   ```
14. Go to the app's dashboard on Heroku and go to Deploy. Connect the app to Github by clicking Github and search for the repository. Click connect. Also enable the automatic deploy by clicking Enable Automatic Deploys, so that everytime we push to github, the code will automatically be deployed to Heroku as well.  
15. Go back to settings.py and replace the secret key setting with the call to get it from the environment, and use empty string as a default. 
   ```
   SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
   ```
   Set debug to be true only if there's a variable called development in the environment.
   ```
   DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
   ```
  

### AWS Bucket Creation   
All static and media files in this project are stored in [Amazon Web Services S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/) which is a cloud based storage service. You can create your own bucket by following these steps:   
1. Go to [Amazon Web Service website](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click on Create An AWS Account, or login if you already have an account.  
2. Login to your new account, go to AWS Management Console and find service S3. Click on Create Bucket.   
   - Give it a name (I recommend naming your bucket to match the Heroku app name), and choose region closest to you.  
   - In Object Ownership section, choose ACLS enabled. and Bucket Owner Preffered.   
   - Uncheck box 'Block All Public Access'.  
   - Check box 'I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public.'  
   - Click on Create Bucket, and your bucket is created.  
3. Click on your newly created bucket, and navigate to the Properties tab. Scroll down to the bottom until you find Static Website Hosting. Click on Edit, then enable. 
   - Hosting type: choose Host a Static Website   
   - Index document: index.html  
   - Error document: error.html
   - Click on Save Changes.  
4. Navigate to the Permissions tab. Scroll down to the bottom until you find Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). Click on Edit, and paste in this Cors Configuration below, which is going to set up the required access between the Heroku app and this S3 bucket. Click on Save Changes. 
   ```
   [
      {
         "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization"
         ],
         "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
         ],
         "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
         ],
         "ExposeHeaders": []
      }
   ]
   ```   
   Still on the Permissions tab, find Bucket policy, click on Edit, and then go to Policy Generator. 
   - Select Type of Policy: choose S3 Bucket Policy   
   - Effect: choose Allow   
   - Principal: *   
   - Actions: select GetObject   
   - Fill in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), from the Bucket ARN back in the Bucket Policy   
   - Click on the Add Statement and then Generate Policy. Copy the policy and paste in the bucket policy editor.  
   - Add a slash star on to the end of the resource key (because we want to allow access to all resources in this bucket). Click Save.
      The resource key should look like this
      ```  
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*",  
      ```  
   
   Still on Permissions tab, go to Access Control List (ACL) section, click Edit and enable List for Everyone (public access), and accept the warning box.  

5. With the bucket ready, now we need to create a user to access it through another service called IAM which stands for Identity and Access Management. Go back to the service menu and open IAM.   
   a. Create a group for our user to live in.  
      Click User Groups, and then create a new group with a name you want. I gave the group the name: manage-shoes-and-more. Scroll down to the bottom and click on Create Group.     
   b. Create an access policy giving the group access to the S3 bucket that has been created.  
      - Click on Policy, and then Create Policy. Go to the JSON tab, and then select import managed policy, which will let us import one that AWS has pre-built for full access to S3. Search for S3, then import the AmazonS3FullAccess policy.   
      - Because we only want to allow full access to our new bucket and everything within it, paste the bucket ARN (from the bucket policy page in s3) in the JSON editor.
      ```
      "Resource": [
         "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME",
         "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
      ]
      ```  
      Now click on Next:Tags, then click Next:Review. 
      - Give the review policy a name and a description, then click Create Policy. The policy has now been created. 
      
   c. Finally, assign the user to the group so it can use the policy to access all our files.  
      - Go to User Groups, and select the group. Go to the Permissions tab, open the Add Permissions dropdown, and click Attach Policies.  
      - Select the policy and click Add permissions at the bottom.  
      - Create a user to put in the group, by going to the Users page, and clicking Add Users.  
      - Set a user name, give them access type: Programmatic access, and then click Next: Permissions.   
      - Check on the group that has the policy attached. Click Next: Tags, then click Next: Review, and lastly Create User.     
      - Download the csv file and save it.  


### Connect Django to AWS Bucket 
Note: If you've forked the repository, all of these steps are already done/ written on the files. Make sure you've installed all dependencies in the requirements.txt file, add all the AWS-related Config Vars to Heroku, and remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable from Heroku.   
Here are the steps I took to connect Django to AWS:  
1. Install two new packages: boto3 and django-storages. Freeze them into requirements.txt.   
   ```
   pip3 install boto3
   pip3 install django-storages 
   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt  
   ```  
2. Add storages to the Installed Apps in settings.py.
3. In settings.py, we need to set cache control, set bucket configurations, set static and media files location, and override static and media URLs in production. We'll only want to do this on Heroku, so add an if statement as well.
   ```
   if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
      # Cache control
      AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
         'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
         'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
      }

      # Bucket Config
      AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME'
      AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'YOUR_REGION'
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
      AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

      # Static and media files
      STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
      STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
      DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
      MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media' 

      # Override static and media URLs in production
      STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
      MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
   ```
   Set the Config Vars on Heroku. On your app's dashboard on Heroku, go to Settings and click Reveal Convig Vars. Set this variables:
   Variables | Value
   --- | ---
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | your access key id from the csv file that you've downloaded before
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | your secret access key from the csv file that you've downloaded before
   USE_AWS | True    

   Also remove the COLLECTSTATIC variable from the Config Vars.   

4. We then want to tell Django that in production we want to use S3 to store our static files whenever someone runs collectstatic, and that we sent any uploaded images to go there as well.  
Create a custom_storages.py file in your project's root directory, and inside it, include the Static and Media Storage locations: 
   ```
   from django.conf import settings
   from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage
 

   class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION


   class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
      location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
   ```  

5. Finally, push these changes on Github.
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push
   ```
