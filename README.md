## Structure

In order to improve the navigation of the website i have organised like a tree to ensure the user navigates through the website
![Project Development](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/d429adc0-18c6-457d-9d74-14d37895b7a7)

I made a database digram to be aware of the additional functionalities i want to add as well as the essential models i need to add to get the website functioning.

### Skeleton 

I made a basic wireframes for the structure as I was not sure if I wanted to stick with the structure I just made sure I had a rough idea on what I wanted on the homepage.

![Homepage](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/97ba1ca1-235a-417e-8d28-edaa680d95ec)

For the products page I made sure that there was a categories bar so the user can easily navigate around different categories. I wanted a like button to be on the side of the categories bar.

![products page](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/0e64f0f1-6b48-40d3-9931-e64f68348070)

The products details page should just have the image of the products and the descriptions of the product and the ability to comment (initially I was not sure if i should add the commenting functionality).

![PRODUCT DETAILS Page](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/6008b188-9871-4e29-8ab6-7dd60b5eb76f)

When the customer adds a item to the basket the basket will hang down the page so that the customer can see what they have added as well as the size of the clothing/shoes

![Basket image](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/153e5466-0c50-4335-8510-c388a4b08194)

Once the customer proceeds to checkout the checkou page would open allowing the user to enter in their shipping details name etc.

![CHECKOUT PAGE ](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/b1efaef4-6b2e-4af1-90cc-214b7d60aa1c)

After the user goes through checkout they will be presented with the checkout success page confirming the payment and an email would be sent to the email entered in during the checkout.

![THANKYOU PAGE](https://github.com/salms358/Drip-By-Salmz/assets/119611403/ba329421-40d6-48c1-b8d0-ef0e50597eec)

These are the colours I was looking to use before starting my project. As the UK street wear colour scheme consists of the colours black and white for example. I made sure colours were contrasting to ensure the users can easily read the text and make a purchase. Moreover individuals with visual impairments can benefit off the colour scheme.
